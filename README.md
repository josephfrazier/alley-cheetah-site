* Generate a static map with markers showing all locations?
  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/intro#Markers
  * Note that the labels can only be one character, so colors would have to differentiate either rows or columns
* Scrape grocery store addresses and prioritize them in autocomplete?

* Use speech recognition or OCR to allow easier input?
